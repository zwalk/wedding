        <h2>About the Bride and Groom</h2>
        <p>Their love story begins when they met for the first time in the galley at 9 West Doen while both working as nurse aids on the burn unit for The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. Chris later sent Miranda a message on facebook to meet up. They hung out for the first time at Ugly Tuna on Halloween where they danced to the wobble all night. A couple years later, after college, they began dating after Chris brought Miranda Taco Bell and came to meet and be approved by Bojangles. </p>
